# myAlarm
Create alarms using your own audio files.

# Instructions:
- Complete prerequisites (stated below after instructions).
- Download myAlarm.
- Open Terminal.
- Type "python3", add a space ' ', and drag the main.py file into the Terminal.
- Press Enter.
- When prompted, drag the folder containing .wav files into the Terminal.
- Press Enter.
- When prompted, tell myAlarm how long it should wait before playing.
- Finally, when prompted, tell myAlarm how long each audio file should play before moving on to the next.

# Prerequisites:
## Install Modules:
These will be automatically installed.
- osascript
- simpleaudio

## Be Aware:
- myAlarm will continue to play until you terminate the Terminal.
- For minutes, you may enter floating-point values such as 0.25 or 3.14.
- It is recommended that you restart the kernal after running myAlarm once to avoid playback glitches.

## Be Cautious:
- The files must be .wav files.
- Simply changing a .mp3 file's name to .wav will not work; you must use an online audio file converter.
