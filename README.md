    - Entering nothing or 0 will make myAlarm play instantly.
- Finally, when prompted, tell myAlarm how long each audio file should play before moving on to the next.

# Prerequisites:
## Modules:

# Note:
- myAlarm will continue to play until you terminate the Terminal.
- You may enter floating-point values for the minutes, such as 0.25 or 3.5.
