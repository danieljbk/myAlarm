# myAlarm
Create alarms using your own audio files.


# Instructions:
- Download myAlarm.
- Open Terminal.
- Type "python", add a space ' ', and drag the main.py file into the Terminal.
- Press Enter.
- When prompted, drag a folder with .wav files into the Terminal.
- Press Enter.
- When prompted, tell myAlarm how long you it should wait before playing.
    - Entering nothing or 0 will make myAlarm play instantly.


# Note:
- The files must be wave files.
- Simply changing a .mp3 file's name to .wav will not work; you must use an online audio file converter.
