# myAlarm
Create alarms using your own audio files.

# Instructions:
- Complete prerequisites (stated below after instructions).
- Download myAlarm.
- Open Terminal.
- Type "python3", add a space ' ', and drag the main.py file into the Terminal.
- Press Enter.
- When prompted, drag a folder with .wav files into the Terminal.
- Press Enter.
- When prompted, tell myAlarm how long you it should wait before playing.
    - Entering nothing or 0 will make myAlarm play instantly.
- Finally, when prompted, tell myAlarm how long each audio file should play before moving on to the next.

# Prerequisites:
## Create or Edit:
- None
## Install Modules:
- osascript
- simpleaudio
###### running main.py in Terminal should automatically install these modules for you, so don't worry about it!

# Be Aware:
- myAlarm will continue to play until you terminate the Terminal.
- For minutes, you may enter floating-point values such as 0.25 or 3.14.
- It is recommended that you restart the kernal after running myAlarm once to avoid playback glitches.

# Be Cautious:
- The files must be .wav files.
- Simply changing a .mp3 file's name to .wav will not work; you must use an online audio file converter.
